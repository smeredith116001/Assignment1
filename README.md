# CSI281 Assignment 1

This assignment will act as a review of C++ concepts from CSI 140 and 240. At the top of each file is a note about whether or not you should modify it. Please only modify the files that are indicated as being okay to modify.

The goal of this assignment is to read a `.csv` file containing temperature data about NYC and Burlington into structs/classes, process it, and draw some charts of it.

## Basic Instructions

1. Create your own **private** repository from this repo by hitting the "Use this template" button at the top of the page
2. Add me (@davecom) as a collaborator on your **private** repository.
3. Implement the missing parts where it says "YOUR CODE HERE"
4. Test it on your local computer by following the build directions below
5. Run `nmake clean` or `make clean` to remove any binary files
6. Push your code to GitHub (Don't push your binary filesâ€”the purpose of the prior step is to remove them). Every push will be automatically tested on both Windows (nmake/MSVC) and Linux (GNUMake/GCC) through a GitHub Action. You will know your code is correct when you see a green check mark next to the commit.*
7. Submit the URL to your private repository on Canvas. Submit even if you are not passing all tests so you can get partial credit.

* You are encouraged to also make commits much more frequently than this, earlier in development. Just don't be surprised when seeing an X on GitHub since not all of the tests will pass.

## Directory Structure and Files

- `/` Main directory including this `README.md`, the build scripts, and the `.csv` file.
- `/lib` Libraries for drawing the charts and testing your work. There's no need to touch this.
- `/src` Source files, some of which you should modify and some of which you should not.

### Specific Files

*indicates do not modify
&indicates you must modify

- `GNUMakefile`* make file for GNU Make on macOS and GNU/Linux
- `Makefile`* make file for nmake/Visual Studio on Windows
- `README.md`* this file
- `LICENSE` MIT License
- `tempdata.csv`* temperature data about NYC and Burlington. You can open this in a text editor or Excel if you want to browse it.

- `lib/catch.h`* a unit testing library
- `lib/PPlot.cpp`* part of a chart making library
- `lib/PPlot.h`* part of a chart making library
- `lib/SVGPainter.cpp`* part of a chart making library
- `lib/SVGPainter.h`* part of a chart making library

- `src/CityTemperaturedata.h`* defines a structure and a class for holding data
- `src/CityTemperatureData.cpp`& implementation of the class
- `src/csv.h`* function definitions for reading the CSV and turning it into CityTemperatureData
- `src/csv.cpp`& implementations of the above
- `src/main.cpp` the main file that runs the tests and makes the charts
- `src/test.cpp`* the unit tests to prove your code works

## Building and Running

### macOS and GNU/Linux

Run `make` and `./assignment1` to run all of the tests. It will also output two `.svg` files when you are done that show the data nicely plotted. Run `make clean` to remove all objects files, the executable, and the svg files.

### Windows

From the start menu (assuming you have installed Visual Studio 2019) open the "Developer Command Prompt." CD to the appropriate directory and run `nmake` and `assignment1` to run all of the tests. It will also output two `.svg` files when you are done that show the data nicely plotted. Run `nmake clean` to remove all objects files, the executable, and the svg files.

## Checklist for Submission

- [ ] Did you add me (@davecom) as a collaborator on the repository?
- [ ] Did you replace every area that said "YOUR CODE HERE" with your code?
- [ ] Did you ensure you are passing all of the unit tests? Do you see a green check mark on GitHub?
- [ ] Did you cite all sources, especially any place that you copied code from? Put code citations right next to where you inserted them.
- [ ] Did you add sufficient comments?
- [ ] Did you double check your code for good style?
- [ ] Did you remember to free any memory you manually allocated on the heap?
- [ ] Did you put your name below mine at the top of any files you modified and any other appropriate places?
- [ ] Did you try cleaning, building, and running once to make sure everything is in working order before submitting?
- [ ] If you were working with an IDE, did you test building on the command line with make or nmake? I will go by the tests of your work with make or nmake done automatically by the GitHub action.
- [ ] Did you check the repository is free of your object files and other garbage and just contains source files?
- [ ] Did you submit the URL to your repository on Canvas?
